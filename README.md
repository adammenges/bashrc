The ultimate bash configuration
===============================

For a long time I've synced my bashrc via dropbox, it's time to move it into a repo. **In progress.**


Installation
============

    git clone git@github.com:adammenges/bashrc.git ~/.bash_runtime
    cp ~/.bashrc ~/.bash_runtime/bashrc/personal.bash # Put your current bashrc in personal.bash
    cp ~/.bash_runtime/bashrcs/bashrc ~/.bashrc # Or .bash_profile if you're on a Mac, change above too.


What's Included
===============

 * Good general aliases, for both bash and git.
 * Nifty PS1. Check it out. Type in an error and see what happens.
 * git auto completion.
 * Much, much, much more to come.
