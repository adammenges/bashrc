#Update
This project has long been retired, I now use zsh. I'll leave it up here for those who'd like to still use it as a starting place for your own thing, but it won't be contributed to by me anymore.

========================================


The ultimate bash configuration
===============================

For a long time I've synced my bashrc via dropbox, it's time to move it into a repo.


Installation
============

    git clone git@github.com:adammenges/bashrc.git ~/.bash_runtime
    cp ~/.bashrc ~/.bash_runtime/bashrcs/personal.bash # Put your current bashrc in personal.bash
    cp ~/.bash_runtime/bashrcs/bashrc ~/.bashrc # Or .bash_profile if you're on a Mac, change above too.


What's Included
===============

 * Good general aliases, for both bash and git.
 * Nifty PS1. Check it out. Type in an error and see what happens.
 * Git auto completion.
 * Much, much more to come.
